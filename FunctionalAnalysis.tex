\section{The Course Commences, 22/07/2022} 

The lecture starts with a short review of elementary ideas of vector spaces. Morphisms are structure preserving maps. An endomorphism on a mathematical structure $S$ is a structure preserving map from $S$ to itself.

\dfn{Linear endomorphism}{Let $V$ be a vector space. A linear endomorphism is a linear transformation $T: V \to V$. }

Set of all linear endomorphisms on a vector space $V$ over a field $F$ is denoted by End$_F(V)$. An automorphism on $V$ is an endomorphism on $V$ which is also an isomorphism (one-one and onto).

Recall that every field is also a vector space over itself. Thus, we may define a linear map from a vector space to a field. Indeed, we have a special name for this map.

\dfn{Linear functional}{Let $V$ be a vector space. Let $F$ be a field. Then a linear functional is a linear transformation $T: V \to F$.}

The following are examples of linear functionals.

\begin{enumerate}
\item A linear map $T: \bbR \to \bbR $ defined by $T(x) = \alpha x$ for some $\alpha \in \bbR$. 
\item A linear map $T: \bbR^2 \to \bbR$ defined by $T(x_1, x_2) = \beta x_1$ for some $\beta \in \bbR$. 
\item A linear map $\pi: \bbR^2 \to \bbR^2$ defined by $\pi(x_1, x_2) = x_1$. 
\item Let $T_1:V_1 \to V_1$ be a linear map and $T_2: V_1 \to F$ be a linear functional. Then $T_2\circ T_1: V_1 \to F$ is a linear functional. 
\end{enumerate}

Consider the following ODE: 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:1}
a_n \frac{d^ny}{dx^n} + a_{n-1} \frac{d^{n-1}y}{dx^{n-1}} + \cdots + a_1 \frac{dy}{dx} + a_0 = 0.
\end{equation}

Let $a_0=0$. If $y_1(x)$ and $y_2(x)$ are two solutions, then $(y_1+y_2)(x)$ is also a solution. Also $\alpha y_1(x)$ is also a solution for some $\alpha \in \bbR$. Let $S$ be the set of all solutions when $a_0 = 0$. Clearly $S$ is a vector space over $\bbR$.

We now define the operator 
\begin{displaymath}
L \coloneqq a_n \frac{d^n}{dx^n} + a_{n-1} \frac{d^{n-1}}{dx^{n-1}} + \cdots + a_1 \frac{d}{dx}
\end{displaymath}

which operates on the vector space $C^n(\bbR)\coloneqq \{f:\bbR \to \bbR | f \text{ is differentiable on } \bbR \text{ upto } n \text{ times}\}$ over $\bbR$. Let $X$ be the set of all functions on $\bbR$. Then $X$ is a vector space (also called function space) and $L:C^n(\bbR) \to X$ is a linear map. Clearly $S = \ker(L)$.

\exer{}{What is the dimension of the vector space $L$ defined above?}

\section{Say Hello to Banach Spaces, 23/07/2022}

A vector space is also called a linear space in that it makes sense to form linear combinations. Defining a norm on a linear space makes it a metric space. Then it makes sense to talk about continuous maps between such linear spaces. Banach spaces are linear spaces with a norm such that the metric space generated is also complete.

Let $X\subset \bbR$. When is $X$ compact? From analysis, we know $X$ is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. We define 
\begin{displaymath}
C(X) = \{ f: X \to \bbR \mid f \text{ is continuous on } X\}.
\end{displaymath}

When is $C(X)$ compact? To answer this question, we need to ask: what is the topology on $C(X)$? Suppose $X= [0,1]$. What if, the topology is the one induced by the metric space generated by the norm 
\begin{displaymath}
\Vert h \Vert_{\infty} = \sup\{\Vert h(x) \Vert \mid x \in X\}.
\end{displaymath}

\dfn{Normed linear space}{Let $N$ be a vector space over $\bbR$ (or $\bbC$). Then $N$ is a normed linear space if $\exists a$ function $\Vert \cdot \Vert : N \to \bbR$ such that 
\begin{enumerate}
\item\label{item:1} $\Vert x \Vert \geq 0$ and $\Vert x \Vert = 0 \iff x = 0$. 
\item\label{item:2} $\Vert x+y \Vert \leq \Vert x \Vert + \Vert y \Vert$. 
\item\label{item:3} $\Vert \alpha x \Vert = |\alpha| \Vert x \Vert$ for all $\alpha \in \bbR \text{ (or }\alpha \in \bbC), x \in N$.
\end{enumerate}}

\label{exer-2}\exer{Norm induces a metric.}{
\begin{enumerate}
\item\label{item:4} Show that $d(x,y) = \Vert x-y \Vert$ is a metric on $N$. 
\item\label{item:7} Since $N$ is a metric space, we can talk about Cauchy sequences in $N$. Let $\{x_n\}$ be a sequence in $N$. Show that $\{x_n\}$ is Cauchy if and only if $\Vert x_n-x_m \Vert \to 0$ as $n, m \to 0$. 
\item\label{item:8} Show that if $\{x_n\}$ converges to $x$, then $\Vert x_n \Vert$ converges to $\Vert x \Vert$. 
\item\label{item:9} Show that $\left| \Vert x \Vert - \Vert y \Vert \right| \leq \Vert x - y \Vert$ for all $x,y \in N$. 
\item\label{item:10} Show that if $\{x_n\}$ is Cauchy, then $\{ \Vert x_n \Vert\}$ is also Cauchy. 
\item\label{item:11} Suppose $x_n \to x$ and $y_n \to y$. Show that $x_n+y_n \to x+y$. 
\item\label{item:12} Suppose $\alpha_n \in \bbR$, $\alpha_n \to \alpha$ and $x_n \to x$. Show that $\alpha_nx_n = \alpha x$.
\end{enumerate}
}

\nt{See that (\ref{item:8}) of Exercise \ref{exer-2} shows the norm on $N$ is continuous.}

We recall that a complete metric space is one in which every Cauchy sequence in the space converges to a point in the space itself. Keeping this in mind, we are well-equiped to define a Banach space.

\dfn{Banach space}{A complete normed linear space $N$ is called a Banach space.}

We look at some examples of Banach spaces:
\begin{enumerate}
\item\label{item:13} $\bbR$, $\bbC$ are Banach spaces with their usual metric.
\item\label{item:14} $\bbR^n$ is a Banach space with either of the norms 
\begin{displaymath}
\Vert (x_1, \ldots, x_n) \Vert = |x_1| + \cdots + |x_n| \hspace*{1cm}\text{ or }\hspace*{1cm} \Vert (x_1, \ldots, x_n) \Vert = \left( \sum_{i=1}^n |x_i|^2 \right)^{1/2}.
\end{displaymath} 
\item\label{item:15} $l_p^n$-spaces are Banach spaces with the $p$-norm 
\begin{displaymath}
\Vert (x_1, \ldots, x_n) \Vert = \left( \sum_{i=1}^n |x_i|^p \right)^{1/p}.
\end{displaymath}
\end{enumerate}

\section{The Misery of Banach Spaces, 26/08/2022}

Normed linear spaces can be infinite dimensional over $\bbR$ or $\bbC$. Recall that Banach spaces are complete normed linear spaces. The linear space $(\bbQ, |\cdot|)$ with the usual metric is not complete.

\exer{}{Can you think of a vector spaces over $\bbR$ which is not complete with respect to some norm?}

Consider $l_p^n$ with $1\leq p < \infty$. Is this complete? Suppose $x_m$, $x_{m^{\prime}}\in l_p^n$. Let $\epsilon > 0$ be any fixed real number. Suppose for sufficiently large $m, m^{\prime}$ sufficiently large,
\begin{align*}
  \Vert x_m - x_{m^{\prime}} \Vert &< \epsilon \\
  \sum_{}^{} |x_{m_i}-x_{m^{\prime}_i}|^p &< \epsilon^p \\
  |x_{m_i}-x_{m^{\prime}_i} |^p \leq \sum_{}^{} |x_{m_i}-x_{m^{\prime}_i}|^p &< \epsilon^p \\
  |x_{m_i}-x_{m^{\prime}_i} | &< \epsilon.
\end{align*}
That is, $\{x_{m,i}\}_m$ is Cauchy in $\bbR$. $\{x_{m,1}\}_m$ converges in $\bbR$, say $\displaystyle \lim_{m\to\infty} x_{m,i} = a_i$.

We put $a=(a_1, \cdots, a_n)$. Now, $|x_{m,i}-a_i| < \epsilon/n^{1/p}$ for $m \geq N_i$. For $N_0 = \max\{N_1, \cdots, N_n\}$, we have,
\begin{align*}
|x_m-a_i| < \epsilon/n^{1/p} \hspace*{1cm}\text{ for all $m>N_0$ and for all $i$}.
\end{align*}
Then 
\begin{align*}
  \sum_{i=1}^m |x_m-a_i|^p &< \epsilon^p \\
  \Vert x_m-a \Vert = \sum_{i=1}^n |x_{m,i}-a_i | &< \epsilon,
\end{align*}
for all $m > N_0$. Therefore, $\displaystyle \lim_{m\to\infty} x_m = a$ so that $l_p^n$ is a Banach space.

We represent $l_p^{\infty}$ as $l_p$. It is an infinite dimensional linear space such that
\begin{displaymath}
\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} |x_i|^p < \infty.
\end{displaymath}
Taking square root yields its norm, which is 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:2}
\Vert x \Vert _p = \left( \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} |x_n|^p \right)^{1/p}.
\end{equation}

\exer{Triangle inequality}{Show that the norm defined above satisfies triangle inequality.}

We now introduce $L_p$ space as a space of functions $f: \bbR \to \bbR$ equipped with the norm 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:3}
\Vert f \Vert_p = \left( \int |f(x)|^p dm(x) \right)^{1/p},
\end{equation}
where $m$ is a measure on $\bbR$. We may also write 
\begin{displaymath}
L_p = \{ f: \bbR \to \bbR \mid \int_{} |f(x)|^p dm(x) < \infty \}.
\end{displaymath}

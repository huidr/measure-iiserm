## [Term Papers](https://github.com/huidr/term-papers) by Ronald Huidrom

This is an [archive](archive.csv) of term papers, seminars, projects and presentations I had to work on during my undergraduate years at `IISERM`. The section headings are clickable. 

### [Integration on Manifolds and Stokes' Theorem](integration-on-manifolds.pdf), Fall 2022

**Abstract**. Integration on manifolds is made possible using [differential forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_form) and [orientability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientability). In
this term paper, we discuss differential *k*-forms and orientability, and how they naturally
generalize integration on Euclidean spaces to integration on manifolds. Then we look at
manifolds with boundary and discuss two classic theorems in differential geometry, [generalized Stokes’
theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_Stokes_theorem) and [Green’s theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green%27s_theorem).

### [Spectral Graph Analysis](https://github.com/huidr/spectral-graph-analysis), Fall 2022

**Abstract**. Spectral graph theory can be used to analyze the topological properties (e.g., connectivity) of graphs. Each graph has a [Laplacian matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplacian_matrix) whose eigenvalues and eigenvectors reveal many properties of the graph. We look at discrete mathematical (graph theoretical) models for biological networks, then study some mathematics of [spectral graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_graph_theory) and in particular, properties of the Laplacian.

### [Turing Machines](https://github.com/huidr/turing-machines), Fall 2022

**Abstract**. A Turing machine is an abstract computational model with a finite control and an unbounded memory. Despite its simplicity, a Turing machine is capable of implementing any algorithm. This gives rise to the idea of [recognizability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursively_enumerable_language) and [decidability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_language) of languages. We also look at the famous [Church-Turing conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church%E2%80%93Turing_thesis) and [Rice's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice%27s_theorem) for undecidability.

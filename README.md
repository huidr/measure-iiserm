### [Integration on Manifolds and Stokes' Theorem](), Fall 2022

Integration on manifolds is made possible using [differential forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_form) and [orientability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientability). In
this term paper, we discuss differential *k*-forms and orientability, and how they naturally
generalize integration on Euclidean spaces to integration on manifolds. Then we look at
manifolds with boundary and discuss two classic theorems in differential geometry, [generalized Stokes’
theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_Stokes_theorem) and [Green’s theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green%27s_theorem).
